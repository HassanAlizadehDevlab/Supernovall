# Supernova ||
### For more detail about the structure of the project see [this article](https://medium.com/@hassan.alizadeh529/the-clean-architecture-concept-5fcbcb1a2a78).

### Data Structure to solve this issue:
I used Trie. Trie is the best solution for this type of data. 
Time complexity of finding an object is O(L). L -> Length

### I have implemented this project using:
- Kotlin Language
- Clean Architecture
- MVVM Pattern
- OOP Principles
- SOLID Principles
- Dagger 2
- JUnit and Mockito
- Android Architecture Components, some JetPack libraries such as ViewModel, LiveData,  ... 
- Constraint Layout and Motion Layout, ...


### I avoided to use:
- RxJava and do threading With Java Threads
- ...


#### I would like to:
- Implement sorting algorithm
- Implement threading more efficient. Like, interrupt old threads when a new character want to search in a new thread
- Implement more attractive animations to laod data
- ...
